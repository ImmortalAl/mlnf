## 🔍 Your Current Credentials

From `.env` file:

## 🛠️ How to Fix (Two Options)

### Option 1: Create New Database User (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard**
   - URL: https://cloud.mongodb.com

2. **Navigate to Database Access**
   - Click "Database Access" in left sidebar (under Security)

3. **Check if user exists**
   - Look for username: `cooldude1343`
   - If it doesn't exist, we need to create it

4. **Add New Database User**
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Choose "Password" authentication
   - Username: `cooldude1343` (or choose new one)
   - Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" OR enter: `JL6cYUVuCzrplWXT`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the password!
   - Database User Privileges: "Atlas admin" or "Read and write to any database"
   - Click "Add User"

5. **Update `.env` file**
   - If you used a different username/password, tell me and I'll update it

### Option 2: Get Correct Connection String

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard**
   - URL: https://cloud.mongodb.com

2. **Connect to Cluster**
   - Click "Connect" button on your mlnf cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Driver: Node.js
   - Version: 5.5 or later

3. **Copy Connection String**
   - It will look like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@mlnf.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/mlnf`
   - This has the correct username and password

4. **Tell me the new connection string**
   - I'll update the `.env` file
   - (Don't worry, this sandbox is private)

## 🚀 Quick Test After Fix

Once you have the correct credentials, tell me:

**Option A**: "I created user with username [X] and password [Y]"
**Option B**: "Here's my connection string: [paste it]"

I'll update the `.env` file and test the connection immediately!
